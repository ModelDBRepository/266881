There are two distinct models that went into the publication. The first was to measure passive spread of electrical post synaptic potentials (ePSPs). This model has only passive properties, and a current is injected in the "soma" which has all the same properties of the rest of the neurite. 
The second model has a 1000micron axon connected to the 4000micron neurite. The axon has active properties.
